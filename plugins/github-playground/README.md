# github-playground

Welcome to the github-playground plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

This plugin serves as a basic example of the the process of creating a custom backstage plugin.

This plugin retrieves the signed in user's github credentials and uses them to query the github graphql API
to retrieve some of their repositories and basic metadata about them.

This is not necessarily intended to be a super useful feature and is intended more as an example of how to wire up
a custom plugin that has some level of non-trivial logic.
